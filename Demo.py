### Introduction to Python

```markdown
# Introduction to Python

Python is a powerful programming language that is widely used in data science, finance, and many other fields. Its simplicity and readability make it an excellent choice for beginners.
```

```python
# Let's start with a simple print statement
print("Hello, Capital Markets!")
```

### Basic Data Types

```markdown
## Basic Data Types

Python has several basic data types that are important to understand.

### Integers and Floats
Integers are whole numbers, while floats are decimal numbers.
```

```python
# Integer
a = 10
print(f"Integer: {a} (Type: {type(a)})")

# Float
b = 3.14
print(f"Float: {b} (Type: {type(b)})")
```

```markdown
### Strings
Strings are sequences of characters used to store text.
```

```python
# String
c = "Capital Markets"
print(f"String: {c} (Type: {type(c)})")
```

```markdown
### Booleans
Booleans represent one of two values: True or False.
```

```python
# Boolean
d = True
print(f"Boolean: {d} (Type: {type(d)})")
```

### Control Flow

```markdown
## Control Flow

Control flow statements allow you to control the execution of your code.

### If-Else Statements
If-else statements are used for decision making.
```

```python
# If-Else Statements
x = 20
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 10")
```

```markdown
### For Loops
For loops are used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string).
```

```python
# For Loops
for i in range(5):
    print(f"For loop iteration: {i}")
```

```markdown
### While Loops
While loops repeat as long as a certain condition is true.
```

```python
# While Loops
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f"While loop iteration: {count}")
    count += 1
```

### Functions

```markdown
## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

### Defining a Function
A function is defined using the `def` keyword.
```

```python
# Defining a Function
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Using the Function
print(greet("Investor"))
```

```markdown
### Function with Multiple Parameters
A function can have multiple parameters.
```

```python
# Function with Multiple Parameters
def calculate_return(initial_value, final_value):
    return (final_value - initial_value) / initial_value

# Using the Function
initial_value = 100
final_value = 150
print(f"Return: {calculate_return(initial_value, final_value) * 100:.2f}%")
```

### Working with Data Structures

```markdown
## Working with Data Structures

Python has several built-in data structures, including lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.

### Lists
Lists are ordered, mutable collections of items.
```

```python
# Lists
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(f"List: {data}")

# Accessing Elements
print(f"First Element in List: {data[0]}")

# Modifying Elements
data[0] = 10
print(f"Modified List: {data}")

# List Comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in data]
print(f"Squares: {squares}")
```

```markdown
### Dictionaries
Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs.
```

```python
# Dictionaries
portfolio = {"AAPL": 150, "MSFT": 250, "GOOG": 2800}
print(f"Dictionary: {portfolio}")

# Accessing Elements
print(f"Price of AAPL: {portfolio['AAPL']}")

# Modifying Elements
portfolio["AAPL"] = 155
print(f"Modified Dictionary: {portfolio}")
```

```markdown
### Tuples
Tuples are ordered, immutable collections of items.
```

```python
# Tuples
t = (1, 2, 3)
print(f"Tuple: {t}")

# Accessing Elements
print(f"First Element in Tuple: {t[0]}")

# Tuples are immutable
# t[0] = 10  # This will raise an error
```

```markdown
### Sets
Sets are unordered collections of unique items.
```

```python
# Sets
s = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5}
print(f"Set: {s}")

# Adding Elements
s.add(6)
print(f"Modified Set: {s}")

# Removing Elements
s.remove(2)
print(f"Modified Set after removing 2: {s}")
```

### File I/O

```markdown
## File I/O

Python provides various functions to read from and write to files.

### Reading from a File
```

```python
# Reading from a file
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

```markdown
### Writing to a File
```

```python
# Writing to a file
with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("Hello, Capital Markets!\n")
    file.write("Python is great for data analysis.")
```

### Introduction to Numpy

```markdown
## Introduction to Numpy

Numpy is a powerful library for numerical computing. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions.

### Creating Numpy Arrays
```

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating an Array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(f"Numpy Array: {arr}")

# Creating a 2D Array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(f"2D Numpy Array:\n{arr_2d}")
```

```markdown
### Basic Operations
```

```python
# Basic Operations
print(f"Sum: {np.sum(arr)}")
print(f"Mean: {np.mean(arr)}")
print(f"Standard Deviation: {np.std(arr)}")

# Element-wise Operations
print(f"Array * 2: {arr * 2}")
print(f"Array + 2: {arr + 2}")
```

```markdown
### Indexing and Slicing
```

```python
# Indexing and Slicing
print(f"First Element: {arr[0]}")
print(f"Last Element: {arr[-1]}")
print(f"First Three Elements: {arr[:3]}")

# Slicing a 2D Array
print(f"First Row: {arr_2d[0, :]}")
print(f"First Column: {arr_2d[:, 0]}")
```

### Introduction to Pandas

```markdown
## Introduction to Pandas

Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like Series and DataFrame.

### Creating a DataFrame
```

```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a DataFrame
data = {
    'Stock': ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOG'],
    'Price': [150, 250, 2800]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

```markdown
### Accessing Data
```

```python
# Accessing Data
print(df['Stock'])
print(df['Price'].mean())

# Accessing Rows
print(df.loc[0])  # By index
print(df.iloc[0])  # By position
```

```markdown
### Modifying Data
```

```python
# Modifying Data
df['Price'] = df['Price'] * 1.1  # Increase prices by 10%
print(df)

# Adding a New Column
df['Market Cap'] = df['Price'] * 1e6  # Assuming 1 million shares outstanding
print(df)
```
